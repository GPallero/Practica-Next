          <h1>Queueing a Series of States Updates</h1>
          <p>Setting a state variable will queue another render. But sometimes you might want to perform multiple operations on the value before queueing the next render. To do this, it helps to understand how React batches state updates.</p>
          <p>As we can recall from a previous example (stateAsSnapshot.html "A little experiment") each render's state values are fixed, so the value of <mark>number</mark> inside the first render's event handler is always 0, no matter how many times you call <mark>setNumber(1)</mark>.</p>
          <p>But there is one other factor at play here. React waits until all code in the event handlers has run before processing your state updates. This is why the re-render only happens after al these <mark>setNumber()</mark> calls.</p>
          <p>This might remind you of a waiter taking an order at the restaurant. A waiter doesn't run to the kitchen at the mention of your first dish! Instead, they let you finish your order, let you make changes to it, and even take orders from other people at the table.</p>

          <h2>Updating Same State multiple times before next render</h2>
          <p>It is an uncommon use case, but if you would like to update the same state variable multiple times before next render, instead of passing the next state value like <mark>setNumber(number + 1)</mark>, you can pass a <b>function</b> that calculates the next state based on the previous one in the queue, like <mark>setNumber(n => n + 1)</mark>. It is a way to tell React to "do something with the same value" instead of just replacing it.</p>
          <p><b>In this case <mark> n => n + 1 </mark></b> is calledan <b>updater function.</b> When you pass it to a state setter:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>React queues this function to be processed after all the other code in the event handler has run.</li>
            <li>During the next render, React goes through the queue and gives you the final updated state.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here's how React works through these lines of code while executing the event handler:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><mark>setNumber(n => n + 1)</mark> : <mark> n => n + 1</mark> is a function. React adds it to a queue</li>
            <li><mark>setNumber(n => n + 1)</mark> : <mark> n => n + 1</mark> is a function. React adds it to a queue</li>
            <li><mark>setNumber(n => n + 1)</mark> : <mark> n => n + 1</mark> is a function. React adds it to a queue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When you call <mark>useState</mark> during the next render, React goes through the queue. The previous <mark>number</mark> state was <mark>0</mark>, so that's what React passes to the first updater function as the <mark>n</mark> argument. Then React takes the return value of your previous updater function and passes it to the next updater as <mark>n</mark>, and so on:</p>
          <div className="wrapper">
            <div className="item1"><p>queued update</p></div>
            <div className="item2"><p>n</p></div>
            <div className="item3"><p>returns</p></div>
            <div className="item4"><p>n => n + 1</p></div>
            <div className="item5"><p>0</p></div>
            <div className="item6"><p>0 + 1 = 1</p></div>
            <div className="item7"><p>n => n + 1</p></div>
            <div className="item8"><p>1</p></div>
            <div className="item9"><p>1 + 1 = 2</p></div>
            <div className="item10"><p>n => n + 1</p></div>
            <div className="item11"><p>2</p></div>
            <div className="item12"><p>2 + 1 = 3</p></div>
          </div>
          <p>React stores <mark>3</mark> as the final result and returns it from <mark>useState</mark>.</p>
