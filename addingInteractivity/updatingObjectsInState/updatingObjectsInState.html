          <h1>Updating Objects in State</h1>
          <p>State can hold any kind of JavaScript value, including objects. But you shouldn't change objects that you hold in the React state directly. Instead, when you want to update an object, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set the state to use that copy.</p>
          <h2>What's a mutation?</h2>
          <p>You can store any kind of JavaScript value in state.</p>
          <p><span className="blue">const</span> [x, setX] = <span className="turquoise">useState</span>(<span className="red">0</span>);</p>
          <p>So far I been working with numbers, strings, and booleans. These kind of JavaScript values are "immutable", meaning unchangeable or "read-only". You can trigger a re-render to replace a value:</p>
          <p><span className="turquoise">setX(<span className="red">5</span>)</span>;</p>
          <p>The <mark>x</mark> state changed from <mark>0</mark> to <mark>5</mark>, but <mark>0</mark> itself did not change. It's not possible to make any changes to the built-in primitive values like numbers, strings, and booleans in JavaScript.</p>
          <p>Now consider an object in state:</p>
          <p><span className="blue">const</span> [position, setPosition] = <span className="turquoise">useState</span>( {curlyBracket[0]}<span className="blue">x</span>: <span className="red">0</span>, <span className="blue">y</span>: <span className="red">0 </span>{curlyBracket[1]});</p>
          <p>Techically, it's possible to change the contents of the object itself. This is called a <b>mutation</b>:</p>
          <p>position.<span className="blue">x </span>= <span className="red">5</span>;</p>
        </>
      )
    }
