                    <h1>Extracting State logic into a Reducer</h1>
                    <p>Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming. For these cases, you can consolidate all the state update logic outside your component in a single function, called <b>reducer</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Consolidate state logic with a reducer</h2>
                    <p>As your components grow in complexity, it can get harder to see at a glance all the different ways in which a component's state gets updated. For example, the <span className="bg-grey">TaskApp</span> component in the App below holds in his code an array of <span className="bg-grey">tasks</span> in state and uses three different event handlers to add, remove, and edit tasks:</p>
                </>
            );
        }

        function TaskApp(){
            const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialtasks);
        }

        function App(){
            return(
                <>
                    <Intro/>
                </>
            );
        }

        ReactDOM.render(<App/>, main)
