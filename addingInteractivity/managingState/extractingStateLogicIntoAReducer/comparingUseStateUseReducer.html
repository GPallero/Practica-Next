                    <h1>Extracting state logic into a Reducer: Part 2</h1>
                    <h2>Comparing <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> and <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span></h2>
                    <p>Reducers are not without downsides! Here's a few ways you can compare them:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><span className="weight-900">Code size</span>: Generally, with <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> you have to write less code upfront. With <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span>, you have to write both a reducer function and dispatch actions. However, <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span> can help cut down on the code if many event handlers modify state in a similar way.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span className="weight-900">Readability</span>: <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> is very easy to read when the state updates are simple. When they get more complex, they can bloat your component's code and make it difficult to scan. In this case, <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span> lets you cleanly separate the <em>how of update logic</em> from the <em>what happened of event handlers</em></p></li>
                        <li><p><span className="weight-900">Debugging</span>: When you have a bug with <span className="bg-grey">useState</span>, it can be difficult to tell where the state was set incorrectly, and why. With <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span>, you can add a console log into your reducer to see every state update, and why it happened (due to which <span className="bg-grey">action</span>). If each <span className="bg-grey">action</span> is correct, you'll know that the mistake is in the reducer logic itself. However, you have to step through more code than with <span className="bg-grey">useState</span>.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span className="weight-900">Testing</span>: A reducer is a pure function that doesn't depend on your component. This means that you can export and test it separately in isolation. While generally it's best to test components in a more realistic enviroment, for complex state update logic it can be useful to assert that your reducer returns a particular initial state and action.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span className="weight-900">Personal preference</span>: Some people like reducers, others don't. That's okay. It's a matter of preference. You can always convert between <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> and <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span> back and forth: they are equivalent.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Writing reducers well</h2>
                    <p>Keep these two tips in mind when writing reducers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Reducers must be pure. Similar to <a href={stateUpdaterFunctions}><span className="turquoise">state updater functions</span></a>, reducers run during rendering! (Actions are queued until the next render.) This means that reducers <a href={pureComponents}><span className="turquoise">must be pure</span></a>â€”same inputs always result in the same output. They should not send requests, schedule timeouts, or perform any side effects (operations that impact things outside the component). They should update <a href={objects}><span className="turquoise">objects</span></a> and <a href={arrays}><span className="turquoise">arrays</span></a> without mutations.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Each action describes a single user interaction, even if that leads to multiple changes in the data. For example, if a user presses "Reset" on a form with five fields managed by a reducer, it makes more sense to dispatch one <span className="bg-grey">reset_form</span> action rather than five separate <span className="bg-grey">set_field</span> actions. If you log every action in a reducer, that log should be clear enough for you to reconstruct what interactions or responses happened in what order. This helps with debugging!</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Recap</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>To convert from <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> to <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span>:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Dispatch actions from event handlers.</li>
                                <li>Write a reducer function that returns the next state for a given state and action.</li>
                                <li>Replace <span className="bg-grey">useState</span> with <span className="bg-grey">useReducer</span>.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Reducers require you to write a bit more code, but they help with debugging and testing.</li>
                        <li>Reducers must be pure.</li>
                        <li>Each action describes a single user interaction.</li>
                        <li>Use Immer if you want to write reducers in a mutating style.</li>
