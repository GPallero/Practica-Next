                            <p>React builds <a href={renderTrees}>render trees</a> for the component structure in your UI.</p>
                            <p>When you give a component state, you might think the state "lives" inside the component. But the state is actually held inside React. React associates each piece of state it's holding with the correct component by where that component sits in the render tree.</p>
                            <p>In <a href={stateIsTied}>State is tied to a position in the render tree.</a> We can see one {counterStr} JSX tag, but it's rendered at two different positions.</p>
                            <p>In the tree it looks like inside a <span className="bg-grey">'div' tag</span> there are two {counterStr}. Those are two separate counters because each is rendered at its own position in the tree. We don't usually have to think about these positions to use React, but it can be useful to understand how it works.</p>
                            <p>In React, each component on the screen has fully isolated state. For example, if you render two <span className="bg-grey">Counter</span> components side by side, each of them will get its own, independent <span className="bg-grey">score</span> and <span className="bg-grey">hover</span> states.</p>
                            <p>We can see, when one counter is updated, only the state for that component is updated.</p>
                            <p>React will keep the state around for as long as you render the same component at the same position in the tree.</p>

                        <p>When you tick or clear de checkbox, the counter state does not get reset.

                            <p>Remember that it's the position in the UI tree (not the JSX markup) that matters to React! If a component has two <span className="bg-grey">return</span> clauses with <span className="bg-grey">{counterStr}</span> JSX tags inside and outside the <span className="bg-grey">if</span> you might expect the state to reset, but it doesn't! This is because both of those <span className="bg-grey">{counterStr}</span> tags are rendered at the same position. React doesn't know where you place the conditions in your function. All it "sees" is thetree you return.</p>
                            <p>In both cases, you return a <span className="bg-grey">{"<div>"}</span> with <span className="bg-grey">{counterStr}</span> as a first child. To React, these two counters have the same "adress": the first child of the first child of the root. This is how React matches them up between the previous and next renders, regardless of how you structure your logic.</p>

                                <p>In that example you switch between different component types at the same position. Initially, the first child of the <span className="bg-grey">{"<div>"}</span> cointened a <span className="bg-grey">{counterStr}</span>. But when you swapped in a <span className="bg-grey">p</span>, React removed the <span className="bg-grey">{counterStr}</span> from the UI tree and destroyed its state.</p>
                                <p>Also when you render a different component in the same position, it resets the state of its entire subtree.</p>
                                <p>As a rule of thumb, if you want to preserve the state between re-renders, the structure of your tree nees to "match up" from one render to another. If the structure is different, the state gets destroyed because React destroys state when it removes a component from the tree.</p>

                                <p>Another, more generic, way to reset a component's state.</p>
                                <p>You might have seen <span className="bg-grey">key</span>s when <a href={renderingLists}>rendering lists.</a> Keys aren't just for lists! you can use keys to make React distinguish between components. By default, React uses order within the parent ("first counter", "second counter") to dicern between components. But keys let you tell React that this is not just a first counter, or a second counter, but a specific counter -- for example, Nana's counter. This way, React will know Nana's counter wherever it appears in the tree!.</p>
                                <p>Specifying a <span className="bg-grey">key</span> tells React to use the <span className="bg-grey">key</span> itself as part of the position, instead of their order within the parent. This is why, even though you render them in the same place in JSX, React sees them as two different counters, and so they will never share state. Every time a counter appears on the screen, its state is created. Every time it is removed, its state is destroyed. Toggling between them resets their state over and over.</p>
