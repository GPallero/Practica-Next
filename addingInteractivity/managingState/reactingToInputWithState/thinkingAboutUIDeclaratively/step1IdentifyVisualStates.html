          <h1>Step 1: identify your component's different visual states</h1>
          <p>In computer science, you may hear about a <a href={stateMachine}>"State Machine"</a> being in one of several "states". If you work with a designer, you may have seen mockups for different "visual states". React stands at the intersection of design and computer science, so both of these ideas are sources of inspiration.</p>
          <p>First, you need to visualize all the different "states" of the UI the user might see:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Empty: Form has a disabled "Submit" button.</li>
            <li>Typing: Form has an enabled "Submit" button.</li>
            <li>Submiting: Form is completely disabled. Spinner is shown.</li>
            <li>Succes: "Thank you" message is shown instead of a form.</li>
            <li>Error: Same as Typing state, but with an extra error message.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Just like a designer, you'll want to "mock up" or create "mocks" for the different states before you add logic. For example, here is a mock for just the visual part of the form. This mock is controlled by a prop called <span className="grey-bg">status</span> with a defaylt value of <span className="grey-bg">'empty'</span>:</p>
        </>
      )
    }

    function Form({ 
      status='empty'
    }){
      if (status === 'success') {
        return <h1>That's right!</h1>
      }
      return (
        <>
          <h2>City quiz</h2>
          <p>
            In wich city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?
          </p>
          <form>
            <textarea/>
            <br/>
            <button>
              Submit
            </button>
          </form>
        </>
      )
    }

    function Outro(){
      return (
        <>
          <p>
            You could call that prop anything you like, the naming is not important. Try editing <span className="grey-bg">status = 'empty'</span> to <span className="grey-bg">status = 'succes'</span> to see the succes message appear. Mocking lets you quickly iterate on the UI before you wire up any logic. Here is a more fleshed out prototype of the same component, still "controlled" by the <span className="grey-bg">prop</span>:
          </p>
        </>
      )
    }

    function MoreFleshedFormPrototype({ 
      // Try 'submitting, 'error', 'success':
      status = 'empty'
    }) {
      if (status === 'succes'){
        return <h1>That's right!</h1>
      }
      return (
        <>
          <h2>City quiz</h2>
          <p>In wich city is there a billboard that turns air into drinkable water?</p>
          <form>
            <textarea disabled={
              status === 'submitting'
            } />
            <br/>
            <button disabled={
              status === 'empty' ||
              status === 'submitting'
            }>
              Submit
            </button>
            {status === 'error' &&
              <p className='Error'>
                Good guess but a wrong answer, Try again!
              </p>
