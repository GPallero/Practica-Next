        <h1>State: A Component's Memory</h1>
        <p>Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction.</p>
        <p>Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking "next" on an image carousel should change wich image is displayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart.</p>
        <p>Components need to "remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. <b>In React</b>, this kind of component specific memory <b>is called state</b></p>
        <h3>In this folder we talk about:</h3>

          <li>How to add more than one state variable.</li>
          <li>Why state is called local.</li>
