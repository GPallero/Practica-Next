          <h1>State: A Component's Memory</h1>
          <p>Components often need to change what's on the screen as a result of an interaction.</p>
          <p>Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking "next" on an image carousel should change wich image is displayed, clicking "buy" should put a product in the shopping cart.</p>
          <p>Components need to "remember" things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. <b>In React</b>, this kind of component specific memory <b>is called state</b></p>
          <h3>In this folder we talk about:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How to add a state variable with the 'useState' Hook.</li>
            <li>What pair of values the 'useState' Hook returns.</li>
            <li>How to add more than one state variable.</li>
            <li>Why state is called local.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The next component renders a sculpture image. Clicking the 'Next' button should show the next sculpture by changing the index to 1, then 2 and so on. However this won't work.</p>
        </div>

    function Gallery(){

          <h2>Explanation:</h2>
          <p>The <mark>'handleClick'</mark> event handler is updating a local variable, <mark>'index'</mark>. But two things prevent that change from being visible:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Local variables don't persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch -- It doesn't consider any changes to the local variables.</li>
            <li>Changes to local variables won't trigger renders. React doesn't realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Retain the data between renders.</li>
            <li>Trigger React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <mark>useState</mark> Hook provides those two things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A state variable to retain the data between renders.</li>
            <li>A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.</li>
          </ul>
