          <p>Arrays are mutable in JavaScrit, <b>but you should treat them as immutable whe you store them in state</b>. Just like with objects, when you want to update an array stored in state, you need to create a new one (or make a copy of an existing one), and then set state to use the new array.</p>

          <h2>Updating Arrays Without Mutation</h2>
          <p>In JavaScript, arrays are just another kind of object. <a href={objectLink}>Like with objects</a>, you should treat arrays in React state as read-only. This means that you shouldn't reassign items inside an array like <span class="greyBacground">arr[0] = 'bird'</span> and you also shouldn't use methods that mutate the array, such as <span class="greyBacground">push()</span> and <span class="greyBacground">pop()</span>.</p>
