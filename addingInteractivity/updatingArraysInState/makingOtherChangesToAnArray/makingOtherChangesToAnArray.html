          <h1>Making other changes to an Array</h1>
          <p>There are some things you can't do with the spread syntax and non-mutating methods like <span className="greyBackground">map()</span> and <span className="greyBackground">filter()</span> alone. For example, you may want to reverse or sort an array. The JavaScript <span className="greyBackground">reverse</span> and <span className="greyBackground">sort()</span> methods are mutating the original array, so you can't use them directly.</p>
          <p>However, you can copy the array first, and then make changes to it.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
        </>
      )  
    }
